    Executive Decision Agent for Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) incidents.
    
    This agent synthesizes analysis results and coordination state to generate
    executive-ready business recommendations with comprehensive risk matrices.
    It listens to both analysis and coordination topics, aggregates data per
    incident, and produces actionable directives when both data sources are available.
    
    Key Responsibilities:
    - Aggregate analysis and coordination data per incident_id
    - Generate executive-level recommendations with risk assessment
    - Produce comprehensive risk matrices for decision-making
    - Determine priority levels (P0-P3) based on severity and impact
    - Estimate downtime and approval requirements
