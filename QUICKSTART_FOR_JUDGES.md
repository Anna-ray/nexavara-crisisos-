# 🚀 Quick Start Guide for Judges

## ⚡ Get Running in 2 Minutes

This guide will get you up and running with the advanced multi-agent system in under 2 minutes.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (30 seconds)

```bash
cd multi-agent
pip install pydantic requests
```

That's it! The system has minimal dependencies.

## Step 2: Set Your API Keys (30 seconds)

Create a `.env` file or set environment variables:

```bash

## 📊 Quick Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Simple Incident
```python
from messages.models import PQCIncidentDetected

incident = PQCIncidentDetected(
    incident_id="TEST-001",
    source="TestSystem",
    description="HSM entropy degradation detected",
    severity_initial="high"
)
# Watch the system automatically analyze and coordinate response
```

### Test 2: Complex Multi-System Incident
```python
incident = PQCIncidentDetected(
    incident_id="TEST-002",
    source="MultiSystem",
    description="Cascading failure: HSM down, gateway failing, cross-border clearing affected",
    severity_initial="critical"
)
# Watch the system:
# - Classify as Level 5 (Critical)
# - Initialize crisis room with all channels
# - Notify executive leadership
# - Track coordination state
```

### Test 3: Learning from History
```python
# After processing several incidents, query for similar ones
similar = memory.find_similar_incidents(
    "HSM entropy issues",
    severity="critical",
    limit=5
)
# See how the system finds patterns and provides recommendations
```
